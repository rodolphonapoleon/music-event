<p align="center">An app to display music concert in all US states<p>

## Description

  In the web app, a user can choose to display all music concerts in his favorite state in US. The app uses the Ticket Master API to fetch the data about the concerts. Just because the list are sometimes very long, i chose to do a pagination for all data received. 
  The app is created with Next.js, styled with Bootstrap and deployed on Vercel.
